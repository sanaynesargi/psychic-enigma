Store each cell as a node with their row, column values and distance from source cell.
Start BFS with source cell.
Make a visited array with all having “false” values except ‘0’cells which are assigned “true” values as they can not be traversed.
Keep updating distance from source value in each move.
Return distance when destination is met, else return -1 (no path exists in between source and destination).
